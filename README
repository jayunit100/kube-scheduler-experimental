This is a kubernetes executeable scheduler which uses kube as a baseline dependency.

It is meant to be hacked on for development.


As shown below, make sure to strip-vendor when you install.  Glide will then make it so that multiple declarations of glog 
flags and so on dont trample one another and cause flag redefined errors.


```
glide install --strip-vendor --strip-vcs
go install && $GOPATH/bin/kube-scheduler-experimental
```
