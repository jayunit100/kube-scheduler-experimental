# This is a kubernetes executeable scheduler which uses kube as a baseline dependency.

It is meant to be hacked on for development.


As shown below, make sure to strip-vendor when you install.  Glide will then make it so that multiple declarations of glog 
flags and so on dont trample one another and cause flag redefined errors.


you can run
```
glide update
```
then
```
glide install --strip-vendor --strip-vcs
go install && $GOPATH/bin/kube-scheduler-experimental
```

# MAINTAINING VENDOR

As of 1-26-2017

The vendor directory needs to be externally maintained and periodically patched, largely because kubernetes client dependencies are in flux.

The way to do this is to simply copy over packages which are missing if dependencies are missing, as an example, take a look at the apimachinery related commits.  

Every once in a while, its good to try 

```
rm -rf vendor/
```

And then rerun the install directions above.  If the app still compiles, then the dependencies are stable and vendor/ can be deleted.
